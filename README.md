# Road and Bridge Infrastructure Analysis Dashboard (PMGSY)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an interactive **Power BI dashboard** developed to analyze **road and bridge infrastructure development** under the **Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)** using open government data sourced from **data.gov.in**.  
The dashboard transforms raw infrastructure data into meaningful insights through KPIs, charts, maps, and interactive filters.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze sanctioned, completed, and remaining road works across states and districts  
- Evaluate bridge construction progress and completion percentages  
- Compare regional infrastructure performance  
- Visualize geographical variations using state-wise maps  
- Enable data-driven monitoring through interactive dashboards
